# intellistar-2-xd-emulator
A web application that displays weather information in the same visual presentation as the cable headend unit [Intellistar 2 XD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliStar2)


## Overview
This is a local forecast segment that airs on The Weather Channel called the "Local on the 8s". The name is because it airs at timeslots that end in "8" (9:28, 2:48, etc.). The forecast is approximately a minute long and provides information on current and forecasted weather conditions. This type of forecast started in 1982 using WeatherStar units. It was later upgraded to the Intellistar 1 in 2003 and recieved various graphic changes over the years. The intellistar 2 had replaced the Intellistar 1 by 2015. This emulator uses the style that started in 2019.

## Purpose
  I made this emulator for systems that cannot run a real Intellistar 2. [the flies were leaked lol]

Most of core animation and logic has been replicated including severe weather alerts, forecast descriptions, crawl text, and the Doppler radar map.
(only doppler radar is working currently)

## Looping
To enable or disable looping, click on the TWC logo in the info-bar in the top-left corner of the emulator.

To get looping working properly, you may (as of Chrome M66) have to go to chrome://flags#autoplay-policy (Autoplay Policy) and change it to `User gesture is required for cross-origin iframes` or `No user gesture is required`
